===============================
 Test 5-text_indentation.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``def text_indentation(text)``.

Numbers
=======

``def text_indentation(text):``.

::

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("""This is. to test? one: I think that yes""")
    This is.
    <BLANKLINE>
    to test?
    <BLANKLINE>
    one:
    <BLANKLINE>
    I think that yes

It also works with no strings.

::

    >>> text_indentation()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text_indentation() missing 1 required positional argument: 'text'

It also works with no strings.

::

    >>> text_indentation(1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string

It also works with None.

::

    >>> text_indentation(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: text must be a string
