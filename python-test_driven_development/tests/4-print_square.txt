 Test 4-print_square.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``def print_square(size)``.

Numbers
=======

``def print_square(size)``.

::

    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square
    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####

It also works with no strings.

::

    >>> print_square(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: size must be >= 0

It also works with strings.

::

    >>> print_square("something")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer

It also works with None.

::

    >>> print_square(None)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer

It also works with noting passed.

::

    >>> print_square()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'

It also works with floats.

::

    >>> print_square(1.0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer

It also works with 0.

::

    >>> print_square(0)
